<style>body{font-family:sans-serif}code{font-family:monospace}</style><h1>smWaterSurface</h1><p>Simple shader for water surface, as one of shaders in “sm…” series, doesn’t have any options. They’re there for compatibility reasons, but they don’t affect anything, apart from one, <em>ksAlphaRef</em>, setting up type of water surface.</p>
<p>Supported types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ocean: <code>ksAlphaRef = -2</code>;</li>
<li>Lake: <code>ksAlphaRef = -1</code>;</li>
<li>Sea: <code>ksAlphaRef = 0</code>;</li>
<li>Pool: <code>ksAlphaRef = 1</code>;</li>
<li>Pond: <code>ksAlphaRef = 2</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think the way shader looks needs to be changed, or new type should be added, please contact me. I think it would be better if water looked the same across different tracks. Although, quite possibly, I’ll add customizable version later on.</p>
<p>Also, in general, if you’re targeting CSP only, it would be much better to set up water using extension config and “materials_track.ini”.</p>
